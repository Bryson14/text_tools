# Runtime Behavior

See the files under `examples/` for examples of what a correct program's output
may look like.  Test your program against the files under `data/` and compare
your output to the provided examples.  Your program should match the example
output in the essentials; extra leading or trailing white space is generally
permissible, except where its presence changes the meaning of the output.

In the samples provided online, lines beginning with `$` represent the command
I typed into my shell.  When you run the same command you should not copy the
`$`.
